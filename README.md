# freeCodeCamp Product landing
This is a website to encourage busy bodies to reach out to nature for much needed R&R.

## About the project
This project is a simple html / css site from a freeCodeCamp challenge. The requirements were to have 
good imaging and an youtube video link to display a product. The best possible product is nature and it's free.
